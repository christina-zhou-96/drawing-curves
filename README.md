Currently allows user to create a pattern off a geometric grid, in this case four petaled. User selects a direction and the pattern will propagate in the same direction until there is no more canvas

Instructions
------------
Run main.py

Press on your keyboard the initial of the direction you want to move in

u - up

d - down

r - right

l - left

Click the arc you would like to start

Wait until the arc is finished drawing, and then repeat for more patterns


You may also select arcs by yourself

c - click

if you do not wish to propagate any motion.


Future directions
-----------------
Program should generate new patterns on its own without user input

Program should include new motions such as full moon

Program should include other basic units such as six petaled grid

Program should allow multiple patterns to propagate once (tkinter capabilities here are limited)
